# KYC/Social Recovery

Identities created through ZERO Protocol are designed in a way that it can be enabled by fully customizable authentication rules. Using technology that is made from artefacts of the now sunset Passport Protocol by 0xPass, OMIDs are designed to let users recover their keys across devices without ever being tied to a user share, a code, or their devices in any manner. Rather weâ€™re creating modules on top, for recovery systems based on email and KYC verification.
