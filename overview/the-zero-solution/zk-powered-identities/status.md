# Status

We have four major identity status, based on the state of the zKYC down to the Score Index:

**Pending**

During the time between an identity being created to being verified, the omID will have a pending state to signify it and disable users from using unverified identities. During this state, omIDs haven't necnecessarily been put in place.

**Verified**

As the name indicates, the omID has been verified and has been made usable.

**RE**

For any reason a user wants to change their ididentity information, the reverifying state (RE) will be given. omIDs can be used in this situation for anything aside the identity information provided during the main verification state.

**Blacklisted**

Blacklisting is a last resort reserved for highly suspicious activity. If your omID is blacklisted, you'll have the opportunity to appeal. A thorough inspection will then be conducted. If the activity is deemed malicious, the blacklist may become permanent.

**Blacklisted omID Discovery:**

Blacklisted omIDs are only revealed when a user requests their score or when a report triggers a score check. This ensures privacy while maintaining security.
