# zkHash

### **Function**

zkhash, refers to an implementation of a privacy-preserving cryptographic hash function used to represent a user's essential identity information.

**Process**

1. **Input:** The zkhash generation process takes a user's core identity data (potentially including real name, date of birth, or other identifiers) as input.
2. **Hashing:** A cryptographic hashing function is applied to this data, resulting in a unique fixed-size string called the zkhash.

**Privacy Preservation:**

Crucially, the zkhash itself **does not reveal the original data**. It functions like a mathematical fingerprint, derived from the user's information but not directly revealing it. This enables verification of a user's identity without compromising their sensitive information.

**Implementation Details:**

The specific implementation of zkhash within the omPassport contract cannot be definitively confirmed based on the provided code snippet. However, potential approaches include:

* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** These cryptographic techniques could be used to prove possession of specific attributes (e.g., being above 18 years old) without disclosing the underlying data. The zkhash might play a role in the ZKP process.
* **Collision-Resistant Hashing:** A collision-resistant hashing function should be employed. This ensures it's extremely difficult to generate two different inputs that produce the same zkhash, strengthening the security of the identity verification process.

**Benefits:**

Utilizing zkhash fosters a more secure and privacy-conscious approach to identity management within the omPassport system. Users retain control over their sensitive data while still enabling verification of their identity for specific purposes.
