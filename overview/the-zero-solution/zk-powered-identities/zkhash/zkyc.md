# zKYC

### **Function**

zKYC, refers to an implementation of a zkHash, which is a privacy-preserving cryptographic hash function used to represent a user's essential identity information.

### **Process**

1.  **Input:**  The zKYC generation process takes a user's core identity data (potentially including real name, date of birth, or other identifiers) as input.


2. **Hashing:** A cryptographic hashing function is applied to this data, resulting in a unique fixed-size string called the zkHash.
