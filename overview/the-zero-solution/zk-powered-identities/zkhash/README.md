# zkHash

### **Privacy Preservation:**

Crucially, the zkHash itself **does not reveal the original data**. It functions like a mathematical fingerprint, derived from the user's information but not directly revealing it. This enables verification of a user's identity without compromising their sensitive information.

### **Implementation Details:**

The current implementation of zkHash is straight-forward, it includes but is nor limited to:

1. **Merkle Proofs:** Unlike the name may suggest, this system uses Merkle trees to keep the root succinct as making storage and finding it efficient onchain. The zkHash plays a role in the ZKP generation process ensuring the data being used for the process is correct.
2. **Collision-Resistant Hashing:** A collision-resistant hashing function is being employed. This ensures it's extremely difficult to generate two different inputs that produce the same zkHash, strengthening the security of the identity verification process.

**Benefits:**

Utilizing zkHash fosters a more secure and privacy-conscious approach to identity management within the ecosystem. Users retain control over their sensitive data while still enabling verification of their identity.
