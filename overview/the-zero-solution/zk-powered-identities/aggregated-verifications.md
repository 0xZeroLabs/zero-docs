# Aggregated Verifications

We leverage aggregated data across multiple supported blockchains and wallets to deliver a comprehensive solvency index score. This score provides a clear picture of financial health within the ecosystem. Additionally, we employ advanced on-chain monitoring to identify and blacklist sybil addresses through their omPassport. These are addresses created by a single entity to manipulate the system. By blacklisting these addresses across all supported chains and wallets, we ensure a secure and trustworthy on-chain environment for everyone.
