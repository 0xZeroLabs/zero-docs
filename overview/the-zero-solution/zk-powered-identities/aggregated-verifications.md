# Score Index

These scores provide valuable insights into the overall health of an omID. Calculated using predefined metrics, they help identify potential risks. If your score raises concerns, you'll be notified for further investigation.

We leverage aggregated data across multiple supported blockchains and wallets to deliver a comprehensive solvency index score. This score provides a clear picture of financial health within the ecosystem. Additionally, we employ advanced on-chain monitoring to identify and blacklist sybil addresses through their omPassport. These are addresses created by a single entity to manipulate the system. By blacklisting these addresses across all supported chains and wallets, we ensure a secure and trustworthy on-chain environment for everyone.
