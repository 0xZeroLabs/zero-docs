# Identity

Using zero-knowledge attestation, our innovative system empowers you to verify sensitive information about yourself without revealing the underlying details. This puts you in control of what information gets shared, allowing you to participate in the digital world on your own terms.

### Omni Identities

omIDs act as the foundation, each one uniquely identifiable by its zkHash. his zkHash is a special cryptographic hash that combines essential user information with a technique called salting for enhanced security. Think of it as a fingerprint, but mathematically derived from your core data. Crucially, this zkHash ensures that a single human identity cannot be associated with multiple omIDs.
