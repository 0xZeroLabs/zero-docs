# zk-Powered Identities

Using zero-knowledge attestation, our innovative system empowers you to verify sensitive information about yourself without revealing the underlying details. This puts you in control of what information gets shared, allowing you to participate in the digital world on your own terms.

### Omni Identities

omIDs act as the foundation, each one uniquely identifiable by its zkHash. his zkHash is a special cryptographic hash that combines essential user information with a technique called salting for enhanced security. Think of it as a fingerprint, but mathematically derived from your core data. Crucially, this zkHash ensures that a single human identity cannot be associated with multiple omIDs.

**omID Scores**

These scores provide valuable insights into the overall health of an omID. Calculated using predefined metrics, they help identify potential risks. If your score raises concerns, you'll be notified for further investigation.

**Blacklisting**

Blacklisting is a last resort reserved for highly suspicious activity. If your omID is blacklisted, you'll have the opportunity to appeal. A thorough inspection will then be conducted. If the activity is deemed malicious, the blacklist may become permanent.

**Blacklisted omID Discovery:**

Blacklisted omIDs are only revealed when a user requests their score or when a report triggers a score check. This ensures privacy while maintaining security.
