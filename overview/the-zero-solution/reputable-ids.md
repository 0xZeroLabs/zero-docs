# Reputable IDs

While reputation scoring could undermine censorship resistance of identities, it can ultimately help to identify those who act maliciously on the open web. Although we plan to integrate reputations as part of OMIDs, we don’t yet have a solid solution to the problem at hand and would require a lot more academic-like research, co-developed thesis with the likes of Ethos Network. This is the only potential flaw that we are willing to include in our design for everyone’s safety.
