# Omni IDs (OMIDs)

ZERO Protocol initially started as being omnichain, but to cover market needs and enable secure identity verifications outside and within web3 (the open internet), ZERO has been modelled to support multiple siloed platforms by design. Although powered underneath by EVM-based modules, ZERO aims to be chain and platform agnostic.

Powered by [S3N](../../developers/s3n.md), OMIDs have access to basically unlimited amounts of identity data and are designed to enable self-sovereign identities not limited by data constraints.
