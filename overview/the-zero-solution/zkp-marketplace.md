# ZKP Marketplace

Identity ZKPs are useless without the context of an ecosystem. While developers should have access to generating proofs (for verifiable and dynamic data), itâ€™s inefficient to repeatedly generate proofs for VCs. ZERO will integrate a hub where VC proofs generated with the platform are laid for quick access by developers.
