# Zero Overview

## The Paradox of DeFi Identity

Web3 thrives on a paradox. It empowers users with data ownership, disrupting traditional control by fostering a permissionless ecosystem. Yet, this very autonomy clashes with regulations and law enforcement's need for user data to combat theft and fraud. Data brokers exploit this tension, profiting from information web3 aims to return to users.

The solution? A delicate dance. DeFi needs a robust Know Your Customer (KYC) system that verifies identities while preserving privacy. This bridge between traditional off-chain and on-chain web3 identities would ensure compliance with regulations while minimizing data exposure and empowering user control. Ideally, it could even assess financial health across both worlds, mitigating solvency risks and misaligned financial capabilities within DeFi. Can we truly achieve both control and security in this data-driven paradox?

## The ZERO Solution

### zk-Powered Identities

#### Protect Your Privacy with Secure Verification

Using zero-knowledge attestation, our innovative system empowers you to verify sensitive information about yourself without revealing the underlying details. This puts you in control of what information gets shared, allowing you to participate in the digital world on your own terms.

### Omnichain Passports

#### Unlock Seamless On-Chain Experiences with Your Omni-Identity

Powered by [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network), we bring you omPassports. This innovative solution allows you to choose a single passport that works flawlessly across all supported blockchains. With omnichain technology, your verified data seamlessly travels between chains, eliminating the need for separate verification processes. This translates to a smoother and more efficient experience for you whenever you interact with dApps on different blockchains.

### Aggregated Verifications

#### Enhanced Transparency and Security through Omnichain Solvency and Sybil Address Detection

We leverage aggregated data across multiple supported blockchains and wallets to deliver a comprehensive solvency index score. This score provides a clear picture of financial health within the ecosystem. Additionally, we employ advanced on-chain monitoring to identify and blacklist sybil addresses through their omPassport. These are addresses created by a single entity to manipulate the system. By blacklisting these addresses across all supported chains and wallets, we ensure a secure and trustworthy on-chain environment for everyone.

### Protocol Governance ($omZERO)

#### Your Omni-Chain Voice in Our Protocol

We'll be introducing **$omZERO, the Powerhouse of Our Multi-Chain Governance**. This revolutionary **Omni-Governance Token** empowers you to **shape the future, chain-agnostically**. With $omZERO, you can seamlessly participate in crucial on-chain decisions across every supported blockchain within our protocol.
